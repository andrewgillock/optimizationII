    "\n",
    "Use 2019 stock data to find a portfolio that maximizes expected return while maintaining that no more than 100 days have a negative return.  Short selling is not allowed.  Apply this portfolio to 2020 data, how many days in 2020 had negative returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem set your objective to be the mean return of your portfolio.  Then define a binary variable for each days' return that takes on the value 1 if that day's return is negative, and 0 if it's positive (enforce this with a big-M constraint) and then add a constraint that the sum of these binary variables must be less than or equal to 100.  This is an integer programming problem."

    "Go back to the saving for retirement problem we did in class.  There's approximately a 55% chance you go bankrupt before you die.  That's not very good.  You should probably keep working for a few more years.  Today you have $2M in your retirement account.  If you keep working, you earn $400k (after taxes) per year, with a 2.5% raise every year.  You still spend $150k per year and when you work, every dollar of salary that you don't spend goes into your retirement account. As in the code from class, each year first grow your portfolio from market returns, then add your salary and give yourself a raise for next year (if you're still working), then subtract your cost of living. You're still going to die 35 years from today.  The market has normal annual returns with mean = 7% and sd = 10%.  What is the smallest number of years you need to work such that your probability of going bankrupt before death is less than 6%?  Use 10000 simulations."

    "You manufacture microprocessors.  There are 2 lines of chips: high performance and low performance.  Your manufacturing processes are not perfect though, there are quality issues in your production. There are 2 manufacturing processes you can perform.  One process produces chips where the performance is a normal random variable with mean = 10 and sd = 3, and it costs $10 to manufacture chips using this process.  The other manufacturing process produces chips where the performance is a normal random variable with mean = 5 and sd = 2, and it costs $5 to manufacture chips using this process.  Any chip that has a performance less than 7 must be sold as a low performance chip, and any chip that has a performance above 7 can be sold as a high performance chip.  Low performance chips sell for $8 and high performance chips sell for $15.  There is currently a global chip shortage, so any chip you manufacture will sell immediately.  If you produce 100 chips using the first process and 200 chips using the second process, what is the standard deviation of your profit?  Use 10000 simulations to answer this question."
